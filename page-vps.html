          <p>
            Cloud hosting is the top-of-the-line website (or application) hosting solution available presently. The technology has already achieved a tremendous level of acceptance in a short period of time.
            Websites hosted on the cloud are accessible anytime, anywhere. This means that hosting resources for each website are replicated on every cloud server in the cluster. For example, if one cloud server has maximum traffic already, then it automatically routes the query for the specific site to the idle cloud server in the cluster.
            In other words, cloud runs the web hosting services, like files storage, SSH, FTP, SFTP, and email services (for e.g. SMTP), etc., on many different servers simultaneously.
            This simultaneous allocation of equal resources on the cloud servers in the cluster provides a great deal of reliability. For example, if one of the machines malfunctions, it will not cause failure or disruption in the entire hosting service.

          <h4 class="partitle" id="article02"><b>What is VPS?</b></h4>
          <p>
            With VPS hosting you’ll still be sharing one physical server, but
            each user gets a specified set of resources, meaning that other
            websites on the same server won’t affect you, unlike with shared
            hosting. VPS hosting provides a dedicated virtual partition for each
            user, making sure resources are always available to you. Of course,
            VPS comes at a higher price than shared hosting. If we’re going to
            use the same analogy as before, then a VPS partition is like owning
            a penthouse, or a condo — there are many apartments like it in the
            building, but you have everything you need and don’t have to share
            it with anyone else.

                <li>
                    More secure. In order to segment the server properly, the host installs a layer of software that dedicates part of the server to you, which make is completely separate from other customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It’s fast. You are allocated more resources compared to shared hosting.

                    It’s scalable. A VPS can grow with your site as your server needs increase over time.

                    Some server companies oversell their servers, hoping that every site currently using a particular server won’t have a peak traffic day.

                    If you choose an unmanaged VPS, it may be difficult to configure, taking longer to get your website up and running.

            VPS hosting can range in price from $20 to $100 per month depending on the web host you choose.
VPS is a powerful and versatile type of hosting that many companies will find meets their needs. If you’re already hosting in a different type of environment, you may be wondering whether it’s worthwhile to migrate to VPS. This is an important discussion to have with each prospective hosting provider in order to understand how they handle migrations, what would be required from you, how long it might take, and any costs associated.

            If shared hosting is too basic for your needs and you want dedicated resources and more control over your hosting environment, then a VPS could be the right fit for you.
